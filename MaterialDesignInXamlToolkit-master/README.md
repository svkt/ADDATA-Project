# ![Alt text](web/images/MD4XAML28.png "How Can I Use The Themes?") Source Code
To load the source project you will need Visual Studio 2015.  Don't worry if you have an earlier version, you can still use the compiled assemblies from NuGet (``` Install-Package MaterialDesignThemes ```).  There are two demo projects in the solution, restore the NuGet packages and fire them both up.  One is a "pure" Material Design project, the other illustrates how to combine with Dragablz & MahApps.
